# Conrad Connect Coding Challenge

This is a test code for Conrad Connect

### To run the frontend
```
cd /frontend/ 
npm install
npm start
```

### To run the backend
```
cd /backend/ 
npm install
npm start
```

#### General description

The application is made with Create-react-app, so it will run at localhost:3001. 

The server will run at localhost:3000.

All the points of the practice are done except for the code tests, which I didn't have time to do.

The application has several components like Welcome, Search, Bookmarks and a main component called App.

#### Version 2.0

Unit tests must be added to check all functions.

Implement Redux to save the status.

I hope you enjoy it! :D
